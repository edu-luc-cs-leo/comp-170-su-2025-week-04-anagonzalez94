# Week 03 Reflection
Regrettably, I submitted an incomplete assignment for last week. I consider my biggest mistake not giving myself enough time to work thoroughly, and will not repeat that! However, let's evaluate the code that I did write.
## My code
For the diamond drawing program, I did not distinguish between an odd and even height like the given solutions. I did have the same core algebraic idea however, just not proper execution. 
For compound interest, I had the correct number of inputs in my header, however did not properly classify the principal or interest rate as float (instead, I had them as integers).
Overall, I also did not include enough comments. Looking back at my code, I don't get enough of my thought process and it is clear that it was rushed. Going forward, I will make better use of my time in order to properly complete every assignment and not cheat myself out of learning opportunities.
